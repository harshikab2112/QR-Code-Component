## 🚀 Overview

### The Challenge

Build out a QR code component and get it as close to the design as possible. The main goals were to:

- Structure the content using semantic HTML.
- Style the component using modern CSS techniques.
- Make the layout responsive and optimized for mobile.

### My Solution

I created a clean and responsive QR code component that mirrors the design provided by Frontend Mentor. The card is centered on the screen using Flexbox, and all styles are mobile-optimized for various screen sizes.

### Built With

- Semantic HTML5
- Modern CSS3 (Flexbox, Media Queries)
- Google Fonts (Outfit)
- Mobile-first workflow
- Vercel (for deployment)

## 💡 What I Learned

While working on this project, I improved my skills in:

- Responsive design and layout techniques
- Managing typography and spacing without relying on fixed values
- Hosting and deploying projects with Vercel
- Using `max-width`, `min-height`, and viewport units for better responsiveness

## 📦 Folder Structure
```
QR-Code-Component/
├── images/
├── index.html
├── style.css
├── preview.jpg
└── README.md
```

## 📱 Responsive Design

The component adjusts seamlessly across device widths using relative units and Flexbox layout. I added media queries to improve text scaling and prevent overflow on very small screens.

## 🎯 Continued Development

In the future, I’d like to:

- Add light/dark mode toggle
- Turn this into a reusable component in a React app
